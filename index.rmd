title: "Amber's website"
---

This website has been created using R markdown. For initial set up, I found [this](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/08/08/how-to-make-an-rmarkdown-website/) tutorial to be extremely helpful. I also used R markdown site documentation located [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html).
