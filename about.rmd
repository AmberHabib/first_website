title: "About Me"

Hi! I am Amber. I have studied Chemical Engineering and I have worked as a process engineer for ~ 3 years. My favorite parts of the job always involved some kind of data wrangling (cleanup, visualization, analysis). On my website, I hope to post my projects and learnings as I work on expanding my data science toolkit. 
Currently, I am happily employed ONLY as the mother to two most adorable children (ages 1 and 6) and as wife to the smartest man alive. Life is good.
